# Freifunk Pinneberg
We build a wireless data network, for free communication in the entire Pinneberg district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.  
So-called Freifunk nodes are operated by volunteers in many places. Internet access is often available. Not only is it free, it's open too!  
Every WLAN-capable device, for example a smartphone or notebook, can connect to the network near a node and use it to communicate with other participants.
All nodes are connected to a mesh network. Nearby nodes directly via WiFi or cable mesh, nodes further away via VPN.
